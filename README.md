# ML-Cricket-Integration-Project
During 11th grade, I did this project with Sundar Uncle to combine my 2 passions -- Machine Learning and Cricket. I used ML to predict different outcomes based on the field, ball length, and player stats.

### Understanding the Data
"INTERNATIONAL_MATCH.csv" contains one row per match and contains Superficial data for each match i.e. Name of the teams, Unique ID for each team, Venue, Venue Unique ID, Date of the Match, Result of the Match and most importantly "MATCH NUMBER". This number matches with the scorecards files and commentary files.

The "BATTING" folder contains batting scorecard CSV files. The name of every file in the Batting folder is named as "XXBATTINGSCORECARD.csv" where "XX" is the "MATCH NUMBER".
The "BOWLING" folder contains bowling scorecard CSV files. The name of every file in the Bowling folder is named as "XXBOWLINGSCORECARD.csv" where "XX" is the "MATCH NUMBER".

"COMMENTARYINTLMATCH" folder contains Ball-by-ball commentary CSV files. The name of every file in the Commentary folder is named as "XX_COMMENTARY.csv" where "XX" is the "MATCH NUMBER".

### Let's Understand the Structure by an Example
A row in the "INTERNATIONALMATCH.csv" file contains match number as "12345" then it's Batting Scorecard CSV file will be in "BATTING" folder named as "12345BATTINGSCORECARD.csv", Bowling Scorecard CSV file will be in "BOWLING" folder named as "12345BOWLINGSCORECARD.csv", and Commentary CSV file will be in "COMMENTARYINTLMATCH" named as "12345COMMENTARY.csv".

I would like people to come up with Kernels and Analyze the Data and mention me when you use the data and I will try to keep the Dataset as updated as possible. I can be reached at LinkedIn, Github, Medium.
